##:To start my Task 2, I first went through my college notes again to revise the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python. I wanted to make sure I clearly understood how we can work with text data and how machine learning can be used to find out if a sentence has a positive or negative feeling. I also used online platforms like YouTube and ChatGPT to make my understanding better. These platforms helped me learn that sentiment analysis means checking if someone is saying something good or bad in their sentence. Once I understood this, I created a small dataset by myself. I wrote 30 customer reviews – half of them were positive and half were negative. I saved this dataset in Excel format and uploaded it to Google Colab, so I could write and run Python code directly online.
After setting up, I imported the basic Python libraries I needed like pandas for handling data, matplotlib for drawing graphs, and some tools from sklearn like TfidfVectorizer and LogisticRegression. I used pandas.read_excel() to read my dataset and changed the text labels “positive” and “negative” into numbers (1 for positive and 0 for negative), just like I did in Task 1. To make the text ready for machine learning, I used TF-IDF, which changes the text into numbers based on how often the words appear. This helped the computer understand the text better. After that, I split my dataset into training and testing parts, trained a Logistic Regression model, and then checked how well it worked using accuracy and a classification report.Once I trained the model, I tested it with some new reviews to see if it could guess the correct sentiment. It gave back results as either “Positive” or “Negative” depending on the text. This whole project really helped me understand how we can use code to understand people’s feelings. It was fun to see how accurate the model could be, even with a small dataset. In real life, this kind of work is very useful. Companies use it to read customer feedback and understand if people are happy or not, improve their products, see what people are saying about their brand on social media, and even help chatbots reply better by knowing the user’s mood. Doing this project helped me learn how useful and interesting NLP can be.##
